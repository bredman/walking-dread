# Yo dawg I heard you like destruction orbs

- We are gathered outside the tunnel door to the fire temple (where we were at the end of the last session)
- We enter the tunnel and see evidence of people being down here, footprints + torches
- We go forward an encounter an open door and send Anais forward to impersonate a visitor
- She claims to have a delegation and message for the "leader" that needs to be delivered
- We are allowed to pass through the guarded room and are escorted to the leader
- We are escorted upstairs and into a large domed chamber with fire elemental columns
- We enter into a large room where the heat is oppressive and there are large flowing rivers of lava
- A large flaming genie notices the devastation orb and screams to attack us
- We realize at this point we may have misunderstood the instructions for charging the devastation orb
- A battle ensues, Aelar is knocked unconcious but on the plus side the dwarven fighters and a salamander defect to our side
- We defeat the fire genie
- Find a room with floating disc surrounded by cliffs leading to lava
- Dar finds a room filled with levers and pulls some of them, the lava levels change exposing a bridge
- Other rooms are filled with junk
- The suspected hot tub is actually a cold tub of water
- We wander to the south and find a room filled with cultists and offer them surrender. They decide to fight and are quickly massacred.
- After slaughtering the cultist we hear someone's voice from a hallway in the south of their bedroom exclaiming "What was that?"

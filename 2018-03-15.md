Andy's notes: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zibPX70RHNtXhanLghW7W4_Uq0yGIWXRnIBYqiIdkck/edit

we row our boat to the port town of kirkwall
we do short rests and regain some life with hit die (some of us) and spell slots (some of us)

we arrive at the port of kirkwall
we dock at a beach near farmland just outside of the city

how did it end up like this
it was only a fish
it started with a fish

we enter the gate
anais is carrying fish in a cloak
the folks at the gate comment on the fish situation, where’s our basket

raz shouts back at them about the basket

we see an good looking well dressed human woman
there’s a dwarf guy with a keg of beer
we ask where there’s an inn

drunken eel — through the center of town

we notice a board with some wanted signs with an artists rendering of our faces — wanted for crimes agaisnt the god

we check in to an inn — the holiday inn of kirkwall—  long rest, have a couple of mild encounters with the hotel concierge

wildflower restaurant — local fare, meh

market square — trade goods, imports… interesting but risky
arcane texts — frowned upon

we decide to get the fuck out and head out the western exit
people are out and about, it’s abtou 8pm, residential area


we see aasimar and skip into an alley

we keep walking and see aasimar at another gate (beach gate by port)

walk to the third gate, the one we entered, and there are aasimar posted there, too

we check the main gate, also 2 aasimar.

we go to wildflower and eat quickly, the curfew is fast approaching

we eat a bunch of great local food, local honey

we eat a wealthy meal at 1 gold
head back to hotel to beat the curfew
tell the concierge we’ll leave in the AM

we rest
anais casts seeming for the third time — we are disguised as the same attractive humans

drusilia goes to stables and buys 5 horses 
anais stays on the street to scope how she’ll snag a cart
she decides she wants a cart

buys cart and wine, gets horse to hook up

so we now have a merchant with a horse and cart
someone on foot
and four humans on horseback

===

anais moves through the gate without incident
gromash and drusilia fumble through the gate, gromash’s horse rears it’s head back…and makes a big commotion

drusilia hops off her horse and calms the horse

drusilia leads the horses out the gate without further incident

we all get through!

…

we head toward Westreach — we see merchants and it is well trafficked and safe

we arrive in westreach at 4pm and don’t want to have issues with the curfew later so we decide to stay in westreach

no walls, small town…

sleepy town. big church temple place on the western end.
residnences are very condensed, stacked, multi-family…
streets are made of dirt, not paved

less merchant activity

we see a couple of aasimar

anais re-casts seeming for the fourth time…

anais brings the cart near the aasimar and does some weird chanting about bohammat. 

anais gets into it with the aasimar but escapes unscathed. the human disguise works… she gives her name as Genevieve.

we don’t see any more aasimar — we see one at the church

people going in and out of the church…


galoman mansion
large residence

inn called the sapphire hammer
two story building
flagstones…


we go to the inn, stable the horses, stash the wine, go to the church.

7 aasimar in the town

we sold a barrel of wine and got free rooms
down to 13 barrels of wine

we go to the church

anais and raz and gromash go to church

anais stands up and starts to check some things out but the aasimar look at her so she sits down

three aasimar in the church that we can see

this makes for two in the square, three in the church, one that we saw when we entered, and one we haven’t seen yet

aelar works the bar — looking for people who *didn’t* go to church

male elf with silver hair…
aelar approaches him and mentions that he’s not at the service…

do you have your misgivings?
of course not, i woul never say such a thing…
from far away
bahamat’s light blah blah

we have traveled far….
would you like a drink?

aelar orders the guy a wine

drusilia goes over to a dwarf and halfling and puts down three mugs of ale

my name is airdrer (dwarf), this is amanth (halfling)
“you’re not alone”

briggant hills, from the far east… the islands

drusilia has a convo, gets winked at…

i leave the building, i am stopped, say i have to tinkle and will be right back…

===

many people have heard what has happened in mournstead…

“makes you think doesn’t it”

“what ever are you implying?”

drusilia, “are you bragging again?”

“when aeron consumes tooo much he starts speaking nonsense, is he bothering you?”

gromash puts a fish in one of the holy books

raz signals, no response….

==

anais leaves the church and vandalizes the town

she reports back to the hotel and tells aelar…

aelar tells drusilia and raz arrives

they decide to leave the town

we head to warrington…

===

sorry missed some stuff here

battle frogs!
people get eaten and have disadvantage
the people who were inside him are released
but it takes ten feet of movement to get out of the carcass

aelar succeeds the death saving throw (deeply unconscious — nearly dead)

…

we kill the other and are out of combat
aelar is p dead
drusilia casts cure wounds to wake him up

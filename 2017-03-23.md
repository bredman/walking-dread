# Session 20 - Anzeladune the inter-dimensional buzzkill

We were deciding what to do in the room of the dead cultists and Lizandra Kaldros (who goes by Lizzy) and four magmans come into the area. She is wearing a red robe. She is pissed and mad that we brought a devastation orb into her temple. She also wants to kill us because we killed her cult members. She doesn't know what the elemental eye is. She said we should take the devastation orb to a town and blow it up to further the cult’s goal. They seek to summon Imix pronounced imm-ecks or Imax), the prince of elemental fire and sweet widescreen views. Many orbs are needed to summon Imix, and they are making them with the floating stone cirle thing we saw earlier. After much discussion we were convinced to blow up a city with the devastation orb. Lizzy was persuaded to come with us and we are going to come to the village and set it off. The magmans are named Ralphie, Alfie, Chalfie and and Dalfie.

Drusillia slipped that we killed all of the cult members people and killed the LIzzy is certain we killed all of the fire cult members that are dead. We were able to persuade her to come blow up the town any ways. She says Vannifer is the fire prophet who can open the door to the outside world. We use the key to open the door to exit the fire temple and it is suspicious to the fire cult that we have this key.

We take the horses to the town of Redlarch, the biggest town nearby. About 2000 people live there. It is only two hours on horseback and we arrive around 11pm. We set off the fire orb in the middle of the town with a sweet critical hit of elder elemental blast. It starts slow expanding and destroying everything and we ride horses away back to the temple.

We go back to the cult and Lizzy is pleased with us but confused by our disorganization and seeming willingness to commit mass murder for no apparent reason. We get the room of the cultists we killed as our new bunk. We rest. After one hour a fire djinnasi (who is nearly shirtless and hot both figuratively and literally), a female tiefling, and several eternal flame priests and guards enter the room. They are confronting us. Vannifer (the cult leader) is the tiefling. They are enemies of the water cult. They are allied loosely with the air cult. Vanner let slip the fiegn of the eye is in the elemental middle temple, but when asked about the elemental eye she was coy and said it didnt exist. We were able to persuade Vannifer that they we can have a loose alliance.

We long rest. The fireorb destroyed redlarch and there were no survivors. 2000 dead! The orb is still expands it radius at 10 feet per hour. Vannifer wants us to go to the town of yardar and set off the fire orb. We negotiate a reward in exchange for the destruction of Yardar.

We set off for Yardar, it is a 5 to 6 hours journey on horse. We pass Westbridge, and Triboar on the way to Yardar. No one says anything or stops us. We make it to Wardar. We wait outside the town and play cards, Fear wins cards. We go into town at 2am. Becky’s character crit hits the box and fire starts. We leave to go to Redlarch to loot shit lol.

Standing in the town center of Redlarch we see an elf in a black robe. It is Anzeladune, who brought us into the world. He informs us that every elemental prophet/prince is trying to break into this realm of existence. Every prophet wants to consume the plane and eat everything. Imix has made Vannifer a pawn by giving her tinderstrike dagger after she was jilted by a lover (and burned down his house?). Anzeladune says we need to kill Vannifer and kill rest of the cults or we will be destroyed along with this plane. No more devastation orb bombs because they will bring the prince of an element in and then we are fucked (Anzeladune feels a bit like a buzzkilling parent in this moment). Get the weapons of the cult leaders and then go destroy the elemental eye. Setting off any orbs, regardless of how many people die, weaken the bonds of the elemental princes. Too many orbs detonated = death of this plane of existance

We still want to loot from the town of Redlarch (which we burnt down earlier). We do detect magic and find a case in the ruins of a house. There is a ring. Fear, Drusilla, and Becky’s character want the ring. They start fighting and Fear casts hold person on Becky and Drusilia to try and get the ring (lol). Merci’s character takes the ring and says lets not fight. We identify the ring as a ring of spell storing. It can store up to 5 spell slots (5 lvl 1 spells, 1 lvl 5 spell or whatever inbetween like 1 lvl 2 spell and 1 lvl 3 spell) . After some debate, Fear gets the ring! We also find 1200 GP.

Before Anzeladun says are you clear what you need to do ?

* Kill the cults
* Get their weapons (Tinderstrike dagger etc)
* Destroy the elemental eye
* No more devastation orbs (boo!)

We decide to go back to get our reward from Vannifer and sneeze if we think it is time to kill her.

Vannifer takes us back into her chambers with her and Fire Djinnasi. The fire djinnasi says he is named Bastion Themandar btw. There is a lots of fancy cult shit in this room and symbols of the fire cult. Vannifer is kneeling before the alter. The levitating disk is the fire node and that is how they build devastation orbs.

Vannifer gives us our reward and it is a wand with 7 fireballs charges. For one charge you can cast lvl 3 fireball or increase by one slot per change. It get 1 + 1d6 charges back per night, but if you use them all in a day you have to roll a 1d20 and on a 1 it is deal. And you must have one spell slot to have it (IE must be a caster). It goes to Drusilla. It cannot be used in wolf form.

We are talking and Fear gets bored and casts hold person on Bastion and Vannifer as we are all ready. Bastion is paralyzed. Vannifer is not. After a long and stressful battle we win but upon dying Vannifer burns up along with everything she was carrying (including Tinderstrike - which we were hoping to swipe right one). We loot their corpse. Bastion just has a dagger. We search the room and find a secret door (maybe leads to the temple of the elemental eye?). Fear keeps the ashes of her body.

## End of session notes for next session

Probably want to destroy the levatating disk so the fire cult cannot make more fire orbs.
Note to self, go back and loot Yardar since we got this dope ring in Redlarch
Cal you got a really strong ring, you have to attune with it before use (ask Scott about the process)
Dont forget the sweet fireball wand Drusillia has, so powerful. Also requires attunement (ask Scott for process)
You got 1850 xp for the session before this one, and 2000xp for this session
Cal I made you a spell sheet https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cLQ5GOJpcP8XdPXdnjtvHUuqy9igQbHCWhrLuIe8mBk/edit#gid=1352801755
Everyone is pretty jacked up, might want to short rest for hit die or long rest. There may still be other fire cult members in other parts of the temple (although we couldn't hear any sounds of activity from the altar room)

## Things to watch out for in future boss battles:

Be careful on spacing for splash damage
Make sure if there is an AOE persistant spell like wall of fire to move farther away and clairify with the DM what happens moving through it, away from it etc to reduce damage
Counterspell is hella annoying

# Session 28 - ?

- We attempt to acquire horses for our journey to Mournstead
- We get 6 riding horses (cost of 66 gold)
- We take a slow ride to Mournstead and rest partway there in the woods
- During our rest we see some Gnolls coming at us and there's a battle
- After the battle we learn that we fought Shusiva and Flind
- We recover the magical flails from the creature but they don't work for us, Druisillia puts them into her hole
- We sleep
- We run into Rufus Brickbeard a merchant, he has a friend Jessop who was detained for smuggling banned literature. He is trying to free him. We offer to help and he will offer us 1000 GP in return.
- We decide to frame Jessop for a new crime and rescue him while he's being transported for trial
- Aelar draws a sweet "more like ass-a-more" diagram (featuring an ass faced person)
- We take this to the Asamar judge in Mournstead and she blames Jessop too but declines to change their plans for him (which is execution) even after we explain the pun
- We enter a Dwarven bar and find a noble elf - his family runs a bank in the town, the asamar use this as well as everything else, executions attract all the nobles in the town so it seems tough to fight our way out
- We decide to attend the execution and; use sky writing to draw a giant "more like ass-a-more" with a butt faced person in the sky and put a butt on the head of the executioner using an illusion spell
- We attend the next day's execution and Jessop isn't there so we don't execute the plan. The crowd is silent in the execution and people seem pretty indifferent about the affair
- We attempt to get into the courthouse after the execution and fail. That evening Raz follows the executioner out of the courthouse.
- He follows the executioner around the town and eventually into a temple. There are 2 other Asamar in there.
- He retreats outside and waits two hours and no one exits the temple. He re-enters the temple and there is now just one (Asamar) priest. Raz cannot figure out where the others went.
- We decide to head to the courthouse and stakeout the building to see if they transport Jessop there under darkness prior to execution.

# Session 28 - ?

## Ben's version

- We attempt to acquire horses for our journey to Mournstead
- We get 6 riding horses (cost of 66 gold)
- We take a slow ride to Mournstead and rest partway there in the woods
- During our rest we see some Gnolls coming at us and there's a battle
- After the battle we learn that we fought Shusiva and Flind
- We recover the magical flails from the creature but they don't work for us, Druisillia puts them into her hole
- We sleep
- We run into Rufus Brickbeard a merchant, he has a friend Jessop who was detained for smuggling banned literature. He is trying to free him. We offer to help and he will offer us 1000 GP in return.
- We decide to frame Jessop for a new crime and rescue him while he's being transported for trial
- Aelar draws a sweet "more like ass-a-more" diagram (featuring an ass faced person)
- We take this to the Asamar judge in Mournstead and she blames Jessop too but declines to change their plans for him (which is execution) even after we explain the pun
- We enter a Dwarven bar and find a noble elf - his family runs a bank in the town, the asamar use this as well as everything else, executions attract all the nobles in the town so it seems tough to fight our way out
- We decide to attend the execution and; use sky writing to draw a giant "more like ass-a-more" with a butt faced person in the sky and put a butt on the head of the executioner using an illusion spell
- We attend the next day's execution and Jessop isn't there so we don't execute the plan. The crowd is silent in the execution and people seem pretty indifferent about the affair
- We attempt to get into the courthouse after the execution and fail. That evening Raz follows the executioner out of the courthouse.
- He follows the executioner around the town and eventually into a temple. There are 2 other Asamar in there.
- He retreats outside and waits two hours and no one exits the temple. He re-enters the temple and there is now just one (Asamar) priest. Raz cannot figure out where the others went.
- We decide to head to the courthouse and stakeout the building to see if they transport Jessop there under darkness prior to execution.


## Bekki's version

try to rent horses
stables - man - yarek (stable keep)

six horses for 400 gold (67 gold each — we got one for fear, too)
if we return them in good condition, we can recoup 50 gold per horse

six horses —> fitted and mounted
two day trek to Mournstead

beautiful; deer and other wildlife… lush green landscape. Picturesque.
End of day… move into some trees to camp…
Aelar takes first watch and notices some creatures coming out of the woods….Gnolls! A lot of them….

8 Gnolls
1 special Gnoll that’s larger…in the back… who is smarter and avoids some of our area spells that created difficult terrain…this creature has a longbow and makes a ranged attack. Gets three attacks.
Another creature we’ve never seen before (scorpion-wolf)

Aelar wakes us up

Battle! The Gnolls appear to be fairly easy to kill—like 30
The scoprion-wolf is very fast btw. It both bites and stings.

Another scorpion-wolf arrives after the first round of battle!
flail of madness, flail of paralysis, flail of pain (three part attack — three tails)

Aelar first fell to madness, but then (mercifully) fell to paralysis…so he didn’t randomly attack one of us. Whew.

“The paralysis doesn’t carry forward…” “You’re just mad.” “…but I’m paralyzed again.”

Gromash is now paralyzed — rather permanent…one is a flail, and one is a tail… the scorpion poison attack is lasting until he passes the saving throw…

((Scorpions had 110 damage))

We put the three-headed magic weapon in the magic hole (Drusilia) — we think we might try to sell it later

13 gold (2 gold each)

Anais (after flubbing the extraction herself and getting help from Drusilia) gets a vial of shoosuva venom. 

*next time we’re in town, let’s buy empty vials, vessels, and bags to carry stuff*

we rest and everyone recovers
we all get three thousand experience points

Anais looks for snakes and honeycomb and comes up short.

We encounter travelers on the road.

Rufus’s friend Jessup Fairleywedge (Gnome) has been detained for smuggling…

Rufus Brickbeard is fleeing…merchant…
Anais buys sweet olive oil from the merchant…and an empty vessel

Ossomar’s are taking ppl left and right. School teacher who was taken for teaching against their ideas…

Crimson Admirals? 1,000 gold to free Jessup….smuggler….spices, banned literature, ….boat moored at…Runswick…

Convince them that we’re converts…

Ossomar are immune to seduction…
They could be tricked with illusion/sneaking… e.g. pass without trace and fall behind…

No one knows where the prison is (15,000 people in town)… probably underground? A portal?

Rufus will be staying at the Bitterwood Tavern…. 

Ten of them in the whole City…they took the whole city with ten… only 150 were willing to fight. A mix of warriors and town folk.
at the courthouse…adjudicator

priests and clerics — operate in the temple
warriors and their captain who roam
an investigator

gnome with short brown hair and a leather coat…

we go to the courthouse to accuse jessup of a crime, in hopes of having him drawn out to the courthouse…so we can identify him and possibly rescue him…

we get past the human guard with our funny story. we get escorted to the courthouse. no one is making eye contact.

buildings made of stone — streets made of cobble stone…. we tie up our horses at the stables.

we go to the courthouse….

another dude in a medieval suit hanging out…guard whispers something to us… door opens…

we see the adjudicator (she’s an ossomar)… they are discussing a case….she bangs the gavel

“very well…tiefling cultish i sentence you to death by execution by the order of the light of bahamat for the crimes of heresy and treason.”

execution will be posted in the town square….

“i’d like to be a mile marker on your road to damnation”


flaming sword, great halo over their heads…
they all show up for the executions except the adjudicator — the priests, the guards…
the investigator is sometimes not there….

they don’t use the town’s prison
from which direction? not known—brought out from the courthouse…

we watch an execution the next day… we follow the executioner and the captain back to the courthouse….
(the weapon travels back to the courthouse)

wooden platform…body is gone…

wooden block is still there… stained, they don’t clean it.

anais puts shoosuva venom on the chopping block…. 

drusilia is camping out/staking out the courthouse to see if any ossomar leave and where they go….

raz is stealthing behind the ossomar with the sword… gromash is following behind….

does a perimeter check… makes his way to the temple…goes in the front door of the temple.

ossomar with sword; two priestesses…. no one else in the building. 8:30pm. they are whispering to one another toward the front of the building. 

slips out, waits around hiding for a while. after two hours they have not come out. peek in…one priest. the other one is gone (but has not left out the front door).

slip out, wait one more hour…they still don’t come out. 

they are back at the inn…

we are going to stake out the  courthouse overnight…

# Session 30

Go to shore, want to set off sail… Jessup doesn’t plan to come with….he gifts us his boat as a token of thanks for saving his life.

Jessup’s boat carries 160 ppl

Anais bites a fingernail off of Jessup and he offers that we’ll want to hire a crew, maybe 15 mercenaries

Anais reads the sailing book; learns quite a bit about sailing…

checks wind, infers that the wind is coming from north….

lots of tacking to get to oars rest…

==

We go to town and try to find sailors/mercenaries

Captain Radwick

Captain wants to know how long we’ll be gone…we say just a few days

We’ll say that we’ll head to Kirkwall after Oar’s rest

15 gold per day! Deal.
One day to prepare…

We reveal that we’ve killed an Ossomar

Den of Evil (a bar)…

We have a day to kill, the crew will be ready in the afternoon

We head to town, pointed toward the Den of Evil

We see someone we recognize; a Tiefling woman and child. The child is sobbing.

Her husband was executed in Mournstead.

We try to assist her but get bored.

We cross town…we notice a gnome with a black cloak/hood.

She looks at us, runs away, looks back at us and disappears in a shimmer.

Gromash runs in her direction and tries to perceive her… no idea.

Anais asks where the Gnomes hang out… gets schooled. Anais is racist. There’s no Gnome quarter, city is not segregated.

We go to the Den of Evil, it’s 10am but pretty lively.

We see gnomes, but no female gnomes. There are some people wearing black. There is a hooded being….

Raz walks around and makes signs; get a response, “Greetings…”

Raz asks if this place is safe. “As safe as anything in this town.”

We learn that the lady Gnome is not from Mournstead. She was in the bar earlier that day.

Anais detects magic…nothing.

Raz shared that a prisoner was freed, an ossomar was killed…

The say that this news must be shared.

I have several friends in this town, I’ll ask them to keep an eye out for this gnome

Good tidings….

Gromash challenges one of the gamblers to a drinking contest…

Finds an elf dressed a bit like Aelar. Blonde hair.

Anais finds books about gambling; reads them.

Raz’s friend has a job; a theft… a merchant who is a bit arrogant, would like to put him in his place… he trades in spices from the isles, saffron… ship in the harbor. Fat, bald, his name is Fedrin… tends to wear large pants. … prized possessions in his quarters….

a mere 15% cut…

Darvick/Darvik is the thief… Raz reveals their name.

“Blessing of the mask with you.”

Gromash steals 25 gold from the pocket of the drunk elf. Takes a lock of blonde elf hair.

===

We leave the establishment…head to the harbor to rob the boat.

We see one person hanging out just looking around… from the boat “i’m on a boat”

Another guy pacing on the boat.

They are all human. They have swords on their belts, but they aren’t like badass looking.

Some dudes carrying a crate off the side of the boat….

Anais starts some madness with north-south-west-east shenanigans to distract the men carrying the shipment and the guy atop the top deck….

Anais falls into the water; panics to get help; Raz casts a spell on a guy who thinks there’s a plank and steps forward to help, falls over the bannister into the water….

Gromash falls into the water, too and starts struggling… the pacing guy gets engaged and tries to start helping

The door Raz tries to enter is locked; lock pick; success… and slips into the chambers

- Box full of saffron (5 pounds)
- gold plated sextant with a topaz on it
- bronze spyglass
- dice made of bones
- locked desk drawer: ceremonial silver dagger with gold handle and black pearl
- elaborate painting on the wall (hard to carry); picture of an island and some trees, very well done, in a nice frame….mahogany with gold inlay

Raz pisses all over the room.

“That’s not how dogs pee”

we go to town to sell our shit

pound of saffron = 1000 gold
about five pounds, so 5000 gold

other items: about 750 for the dagger and 750 for the sextant — will give us 600 each for the dagger and sextant
bronze spyglass about 200 — will give 150 for the spyglass

he gives us gold from the chest

(6,600 gold) or 1100 each (includes Aelar)

information: there was a female gnome as Rain. She was asking around town about a group of adventurers matching your description, specifically mentioned a tiefling and a half-orc.

“eat the rich…”

we get to the harbor and want to get out of town…

we’re on the boat… to oar’s rest

sail through the isthmus and drop anchor near shore for the night

night passes uneventfully
the weather is calm
we continue to oar’s rest, the wind favors us

make landfall in oar’s rest

trees are different, more like palm trees. we see destroyed structures. looks like recently destroyed ruins.

stone structures.

we go check it out…. inland. it’s lush.

does anyone recognize these foot prints?

not a creature we’ve seen before; seems like maybe some sort of amphibious humanoid…

we don’t see any people in the ruined city; carts turned over… things strewn about. no living creatures that we can see.

drusilia starts searching a cart and hears a sound from overhead… it’s a fiery owl!

we hear a screech. there are two of them.

===

battle

kill the first bird, gromash and drusilia take fire damage and falling damage…

bird is ash… but there’s an egg. we collect the egg and put it in the portable hole.

gromash destroyed the first egg

we slain two sun hawks

we have one viable egg

==

as we rest, we encounter some creatures
they are friendly…
they are impressed that we destroyed the sun hawks

these are the merfolk… these are the footprints we saw

they call themselves the “sea’s heralds”

the ossomar used powerful creatures, including the sun hawks…
they left the sun hawks to partrol the island…

There’s also a dragon…

The merfolk have been here for a year. The siege took place about two years ago.

power center…artifact… rumors. The merfolk don’t know where it is.

they’ve heard that the ossomar have not yet taken to the sea; the sea i safe.

the island is safe if you know how to avoid the sun hawks

not collaborating with other groups…

dragon: used to destroy these buildings, the dragon flies around, it’s free….it’s silver, good aligned.

there are other creatures in this realm…we come from the elemental plane of water… kraken…we followed them to defeat them…watch out for there are krakens in the water…

they stay in deeper water. staying in shallower areas will help. stay near the coast for safety.

kraken: they are immune to anything non magical…such as piercing or fire. they create poison ink cloud… they don’t speak. as far as we can tell, they don’t respond to verbal language.

we have agents in various locations: gives us a shell…. if we blow into the shell, they know we are friends. we now have a conch. we tend to be anywhere there is water.

occasionally in lakes, too!

We plan to go to Eluan next….for some side quests

level up to 12. 100k experience points

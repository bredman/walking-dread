# Session 35

- The staff of domination can cast Dominate Monster. It's hella strong, so we decide to keep it. Anais gets it for some reason
- We head to Stormkirk to find the sacred texts
- Obscure our footprints on the way to Stormkirk, in case the Asamar come back to the cave
- We disguise the staff as a bindle and head on our way
- After a long discussion about weddings we arrive at Stormkirk
- A single happpy guard watches Stormkirk and we are able to walk in, while disguised (with that spell) as merchants (not too beautiful, not too ugly)
- It's a small city - only a couple thousand people live here
- We head to the pub (Minstrel's Alehouse)
- We find that the Alehouse is quite nice
- The town has no Asamar as the wizards in the tower pay a hefty tax to them to keep the town free
- We trade barrel of wine for accomodation and 10 gold, Anais panics that she has been scammed and drinks as much wine as she can
- Decide to head to the tower to find sacred texts
- Anais is in a stupor (from the wine) and needs to be carried
- The magic door lets us in when we say a bunch of different things, 
- The stairs are lit by magic torches. Anais licks the torch in an attempt to steal its magic, but it does nothing
- A halfling wizard points us up the stairs to the Dean's office
- We head to meet Ceeranes the Dean
- She is convinced to allow us in exchange for reducing her payments to the Asamar by destroying them
- She tells us there is a religious professor who will grant us access to the texts, if we pass his tests
- We pass the first test because it is simple (cycle a plant trhough the seasons with water, light, wind and cold)
- We enter a new room with a hooded creature with a scythe
- We are able to solve the riddle and find the location of the wizard
- We proceed to the final puzzle - the grid of chess pieces
- We solve it and meet a very old half-elf down a staircases
- To understand Asamar understand Bahamat, a platinum dragon
- Bahamat lives on the plane of Celestia, he is very compassionate
- Bhamat doesn't love treasure as much as other dragons, he values wisdom, song and prophecy
- His worshippers show their faith through good deeds not through temples
- The Asamar don't behave as his disciples in this regard
- The clergy of Bahamat doesn't have ritual but the Asamar do
- Bhamat believes in order but also freeing the oppressed, the Asamar do not
- There are two kinds Asamar; regular ones and evil ones
- Regular ones cast a magical light, but not much beyond that. Regular Asamar can die
- Evil asamar include the Fallen, the Scourge and the Deva
- The Fallen no longer worship Bahamat (they seek their own power), so that can't be who we're fealing with
- The Scourge are consumed to destroy evil before all things, so that can't be it either
- The Deva can be reborn via a trip through the celestial plane - sounnds like our guys
- The Asamar that have come here have wings and the ability to return from the dead
- The power of the Deva's to return to a realm is dependent on the will of their god so there must be portal here (since their god won't bring them back)
- Bahamat must not have the ability or power to see what the Deva Asamar are doing or else he would come here and fuck shit up
- The theory of where the portal may be; the Feywild or the Devil's Chasm
- The takeover started in Tarn, but not until after the Deva had been here for a while
- He thinks the Asamar did not open the portal but that they had assistance, possibly another God?
- We get the ring of 3 wishes which allows to cast 3 Wish spells - no recharge
- After some discussion we decide to head out to Glass Lake and then to (??whatever the next town along was) before heading to the chasm
- On the road we encounter a bunch of sneks who we at first think are trying to sell us drugs but instead turn out to be attacking
- Noaszu is a snake we have dominated for the next month, a ripped female snake with v. well defined pecs

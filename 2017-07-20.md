- We run into a weird three legged monster being fed gemstones by a cult - Gorx is the three legged creature. This transfers gems to elemental plane
- "We walk in the shadow of ogremonk" - Keltar the cultist
- We walk into a mud river room
- We climb some walls and there is a descending passage to a room filled with crystals, Anais is taken by the confusions
- We descend again to a room with a high bridge, we cross under the bridge and are surrounded by crab people
- They are tough and we flee
- We cross the bridge and the huge boulder awakens and asks for a password. We say "Gems are good" and "we walk in the shadow of ogremonk". One of those is acceptable
- We walk into a room with a bunch of cultists worshipping crystals, we interrupt their meditation and are allowed to "walk in the shadow of ogremonk"
- Our attempts to meditate with the crystals fail
- We enter a room with broken stone walls resembling kennels and saddles and harnesses hanging. There are 3 baby bulettes in pens that are sleeping.
- We work our way north and enter a huge chamber with large columns and glowing crystals. An altar in the room changes shape continuously and two earth elementals mermadons next to it.
- We destroy the portal using ironfang and the earth opens, we flee
- We descend to the lower level but are trapped in the middle of a lava pool and surrounded by people (?) hurling fireballs at us. We kill them. Grommash finally gets his fire cloak
- Druisillia transforms to an eagle and carries Anais over to press a button and the pillars rise up
- There is a sleeping fire giant, some fire pools, and an oddly place gong
- We fight the fire giant and win but he/she is a tough mofo

# Session 18 - Orb acquisition

In town, Raz communicates with thieves’ guild, we are directed to pub “Kiss and Hug??” <— don’t remember name of pub
We sit down, Fear inquires about auction, we are directed to a small locked room/office

We meet Nuriyn Dist, human thief. Has 2 bodyguards. All non-magical.

* Stole the orb from a constable
* Orb: thick glass sphere, 10lbs, 10 inches in diameter
* inside the sphere is a core, inscribed with weird symbols
* it's packed in small wooden cask, filled with water, sealed with wax
* elemental fire magic
* it's unstable and needs to be transported very carefully

There was a blind auction with a minimum bid of 1,500G. Nuriyn agreed to a 'buy it now' price of 2,000G.

Anais negotiated to pay an extra 200 gold if Nuriyn would pretend the auction was still going on for several days.

Takes 1,100G and puts it in a safe; will get the rest on delivery of the orb.

Nuriyn gets hit with a crossbow bolt from the window. Then another. Fear runs to the window but can't see anyone.
Drusillia heals her and we set off to get the orb.


## The tomb

Nuriyn leads the party northeast end of the city to a gaveyard; three humans are gathered around a crypt with a giant fish guy.

Fish guy is 8 feet tall, hidden under a cloak he has four arms.
3 humans; 2 veterans and a priest. Some are called Saguin and Unfurth.

Daar spots a person stalking in shadows with crossbow, probably our assassin from earlier. She throws her axes at them and combat kicks off.

Azaghal takes more than 100 damage from the fish guy in the first round and falls unconcious.

Raz ended up in a choke hold with fish guy, couldn’t breathe…

Fear and Drusillia both missed with their shiny new level 4 spell slots. Drusillia was going to polymorph the fish, which would have been legit.

Daar killed the woman(!) with the crossbow, the humans die and eventually fishface dies too. One of the humans has emeralds worth 1,200G. Nice!

Inside the tomb are the remains of lord and lady, and a wooden containment cask…

The orb will cause a dry heat wave upon detonation for 24 hours within an area.
Starts as 10 sq ft area, every six seconds, expands another 10 square feet.
It will automatically detonate in 91 hours from now.

The party use Nuriyn (who joined in the fighting and wants to GTFO) to get a caravan, then pick up the orb and take their horses out of town.

* 14 hours to red larch; 76 hours left on orb
* 6 hours to burning man area (scarlet moon hall); 70 hours remaining on orb

The magic key opens the temple door under the tower and a red tunnel beacons…

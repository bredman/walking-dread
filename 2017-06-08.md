# Session 22 - Step 4: Prophet!

- We rest successfully
- Orna tells us she has not been down here, she was brought down here unconscious
- We find a large chasm that we can't find the bottom of
- The room to the south has a lot of uncured pelts, crumbling masonry, at an ettin
- ettin is named Brug & Norb (each head), accepts our gift of a body to eat. He sits by a door that opens to another cult
- We leave Brug & Norb to his job (which appears to be just living here)
- We open the door to the north of the hot tub
- There is a bunch of durgar that appear to be slaves working a forge
- There is a Tao guarding the durgar, Fear says we are here to murder her
- Tao (Jarvabartam) says she won't fight puny mortals, Marlos Urnrayl did not pay her for this
- Jarvabartam is here to help to bring Ogormonk the elemental prince for black earth into the plane
- Devastation orbs are being produced here
- The chasm is being mined to produce weapons
- We exit and leave to the north
- We enter a new room to the north and find 2 sleeping guards and 3 people sitting around a table. One was a priest. We tell them we were on patrol and everything is fine.
- We head down a staircase into darkness, there is lots of deep earth groaning
- It turns out the deep groaning was actually an alarm and the group of guards from the room rush us
- We slaughter them and descend the staircase
- We find a enchanted dwarven sarcohogus for an old dwarven hero and it is emitting a spell that gives a benefit to all good aligned beings (not us)
- We find a pair of giants guarding the "hall of the black crystals" they are with the black earth. We lose a game of tic-tac-toe to them and they are friendly offering us directions.
- Baal is the name of one giant, Carg is the name of the other
- They give us directions to a "warm" area of the downstairs (to the west)
- There is a cloud of black fog that is magical and doesn't allow sound to pass
- In the middle of the room is an amorphous tentacled human body with tentacles (on it's face) and it is hunched over crystal (cousin it with tentacles)
- Anais casts detect magic on the crystal it is magic and has the school of transmutation
- We pull the crystal out and Dar luckily resist the spell that tries to transmute her
- Raz goes to get some shrooms but gets jumped by a freaky floating creature (a Grel)
- We go into yet another room with a stone ziggurat with a figure that is bound and bleeding at it's base. There is a large dude swinging a mace at the top of the altar, there are two gargoyles, and two monks.
- The dude with the mace is Marlos Unrayl, he lets us know that the ziggurat is the elemental eye. The eye is used to bring creatures through including Ogormonk, it is not the eye. It's not clear what the node is compared to eye.
- Anais offers to sacrifice and pledge allegiance hoping to steal the weapon but Marlos sees through this
- We end up fighting after Marlos calls us out on our bullshit.
- We are able to fairly quickly dispatch them and kill Marlos last. We recover a sick thunder pick weapon from him and give it to Azaghal

# Session 34 - The one with the naked cave dwarf

- Grommash and Raz throw Druisillia & Fear into the bag and follow Anais and Aelar into the woods
- In the woods run into a fairy dragon that lets us know that the artifact is unguarded in the forest
- Fairy Dragon: "You have been very bad, the angel people went away to look for you"
- Fairy Dragon: "This way this way, there are still monsters in the cave"
- Grommash and Raz catch up to Anais and Aelar
- Fairy Dragon: "The pits of the perished lie ahead, follow the glowing mushrooms"
- Grommash grapples Aelar into the bag
- Fairy Dragon: "That was not very nice!"
- Fairy Dragon: "The item you need is in the cave. I don't care if you defeat the angels or not, make your choice"
- Grommash turns to leave but is compelled by the same magic to stay and venture into the cave
- Everyone gets freed from the bag and we arrive at the cave and enter
- As we get into the cave we see a shadow sneak around a corner
- We find a naked dwarf hanging out in the room. The dwarf is whispering "I'll make it back to her, I'll make it back to
  her"
- Anais decides to just kill the creepy dwarf with Eldritch Blast
- Grommash jumps in the way of the blast and takes the hit from the blast
- Anais repositions and Grommash takes another dive
- Aelar grapples Grommash and during the struggle Anais blasts and kills the dwarf
- We venture further in and find more naked chanters that are muttering things like: "it will be fine", "count to five",
  "must get back", "please don't"
- We grab the elf from the naked chanters who is "the hot one"
- The next room holds a vaguely human figure hunched over and staring at us. It is faintly breathing.
- It shrieks and runs at us, after a quick thinking fireball attack Druisillia kills and shortly afterwards 7 others drop down
  from the ceiling
- The fighting is fierce but we are able to defeat them pretty quickly
- Searching the rest of the cavern we find a curious pile of bones but little more
- We venture deeper and eventually find a large fissure. Out of it rises a (face) tentacled beast and then 10 mushroom people. They all attack us
- Lots of death on our part, and eventually theirs. Anais is almost tentacled by the floating thing but Grommash makes 
  heroic effort to kill the face tentacled beast (we later find out this would have been a permadeath
indicent)
- We are pretty beat up but manage to kill all the creatures
- After the battle, we retrieve a skull belt from one of the dead enemies (for Fear)
- We inspect the crevice/fissure and it is about 15 feet deep with nothing in it
- We still hear chanting: "success will be meaningless", "your family has forgotten you", etc.
- We take a short rest and cross the crevice (which is suprisingly easy)
- A giant brain appears and casts a spell that stuns nearly all our party except for Druissilia. Things look bleak
- Gradually the rest of us recover but Raz is controlled by the giant brain and attacks us (really just Aelar). Since
  he's stunned and can't fight back she stays under the sway of the brain.
- Eventually we are able to kill the giant brain and some minions
- After killing the brain we find a giant staff of power at a altar behind the pool it was in. Anais is attuning to it but we don't know yet what it does (it is the artifact?)

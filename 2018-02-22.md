# Session 31

we set sail and encounter a storm
we go below deck
we get seasick and mostly all end up exhausted except drusilia

storm is over
pirate ship in the distance
we start fighting it, it is beating us bad
we think about surrendering

we ponder the grappling hooks
we decide to feign surrender by raising the white flag
drusilia casts walk on water on the entire party

the boat approaches
we see a pirate queen
crimson admirals

We name Locag — he’s a goliath
we do a bunch of negotiation and convince them that we are the real deal
that we killed an assumear and that we do really know locag

They are _finnaly_ convinced and agree to help us
they accompany us…

we dock in eluan
pay 25g to dock
gromash picks the pocket and takes back the 25g
anais gets weird and asks to borrow a book


captain brass is the lady captain from the crimson admirals
admiral beckettbrass

congregate around places of worship and law
“admiral brass, where can I find more ass?”

aelar and admiral brass are feeling each other

fish mongers
gromash buys fifty fish for 50g and puts them in a bag
they smell already
barrel of fish

anais quests off on her own, in search of a place of worship

people about the town seem more cheerful

Ealar walks into a tavern and shouts,
“eluan, no shirts on!”

Gromash talks to a dude. Offers a fish.
“I challenge you to a fish eating contest!”

Raw sashimi…. he concedes.

“No deal.”

Fishing, family. 

“Who do you pay taxes to?”

“You can stare if you want” - Ealar

“Oh the assamar, they’re the greatest…they really cleaned this town up…”

“they taught us about the true god…”

policing the seas: the seas still aren’t safe.

Only a few assamar in Eluan… many more in Kirkland.

Books at the temple.. northern part of town.

Ealar pours beer on his chest.

be earnest to accept mohhammet

they can tell disingenuity

Caeldra (Kale-dra)

===

As we walk away, a woman approaches Raz and signals with her hands
…

What is it you seek?
What all men seek?
We have an interest in an assamar…
The sheep are subdued and have begun to accept their hunters…

We will be noticed. It’s not common for a band of travelers to be here.

How many assamar? five. 

not allat the temple

they’ve grown complacent, they are spread thin.
anyone could strike when the moment is right.

advice: lay low, keep quiet, and watch. until i see an advantage.

asks for proof.

gromash shows the assamar cape.

we negotiate over an artifact and loyalty.

they offer the patrol patterns.

at night, one of them patrosl the docks. one stays in the temple,
the third goes to the town hall, the fourth patrols this area near the tavern; the fifth and final assomar has no pattern and is inconsistent. during the day they are all in the same place. will be easier to strike at night.

where can we find you? here at the tavern, most of the time.

name is ketuan (ket-u-an) — she’s an elf.

==

we decide to find an inn and long rest to shake off the exhaustion.

we rest and plan for the next night’s attack

the mercenaries agree to hurl arrows at our call

we stage a faux attack on a “damsel in distress”

we see a hulking assomar, calm…looking around…

we fake our struggle and lure the assomar on to the boat and sneak attack…

poison is not effective

we’re in combat! everyone is fightin and hurling and such. 

fire is effective.

the assomar yells to the town for reinforcements.

we incapacitate the assomar and put the shackles on
we put the head in the hole

loot the corpse

put the body and head in the hole

put the fish on the blood

anais collects assomar blood in a vial

dock guy arrives with sword and is curious and confused

we play along…

deception check… the dock guy is convinced
.
we must alert the assomar

anais walks with the guy and splashes assomar blood all over the guy, then walks back

we order the mercnearies to clean up the fish and blood mess and clean up the blood

go back to “sleep” and pretend to be surprised

after about 20 minutes two assomar come over…and there’s a crowd of people with them…

we fuck up.

anais fucks up, really.

we decide to fight them…

Gwendolyn and (name)

there are two

raz slashes them! magic slashing! yah!

gwendolyn is dead!

“in that case, i’ll just attack this guy with my flame blade”

we stun the second one

we remove the shackles from the one, it dissipates

we shackle the other
we behad them and put them in the hole

we all head to the tavern together

ketuan is there.
she says she heard some commotion
we say we have some proof
she says “let’s *head* into a room,”

we go to a room and show an assomar head.

she asks “how?”
we say it was the third tonight

“i’ll blow your mind” -ealar

ketuan has been spying,
they refer to it as The Artifact

they wrested this from the Legion of Dusk (the vampires) — it can turn the tide of a great battle by allowing it’s bearer to take control of monsters…. provenance unknown… building safe places for themselves and their treasures…. guided by monsters.

have devoted much much time to learning about the powers of The Artifact.

Pits of the Perished is the place, a name they made up themselves, or a very old place… a place northeast of here…

Ancient texts? Mountwaint? or Stormkirk — more scholars there. Seems we could learn of this place “Pits of the Perished” via ancient texts?

Mountwent, northeast of the capital of Tarun.

We should go into hiding….

Dangerous between here and Warrington…

Dark forest: have not been there, magical creatures

we ask her to send word to the boat to leave the area, we send her off with 100gp

let’s go to kirkwall in the magic boat. pass without trace.

# Session 36

- We visit Glass Lake on our way to Mountwend and oddly smell the ocean somehow
- The trip through the forest to Mountwend is oddly quiet and there are no guards when we arrive
- We disguise ourselves and enter the town (of ~1000 people)
- The town is covered in blood and there are signs of a struggle
- There are bloody footprints and the doors of the houses are all tossed open
- Valuables are strewn about the houses and the town
- Raz finds a bunch of personal sized pits in the middle of town
- They are covered with earth but she is able to see them
- We ask the Yuan-ti what his name is; it is Snek-Pec
- Aelar searches for a brothel to find some erotic statues, enters the Inn and searches but finds nothing
- We instruct Snek-Pec to dig up the hole and we find a body with blood on it
- Grommash is massaging Snek-Pec as he digs
- We search for survivors: Church of Bahamat is covered in blood and the altar is destroyed
- In the church we find a secret drawer with records of executions, crimes, etc. there are very few recent listings
- There are more recent records of rumors and other information on townspeople (we take the records)
- There are also the name of Asamar informants in the records
- We find the location of a brothel in the records
- Aelar finds the brothel and is able to narrow down that it's been 2 days since the last sexual act, recovers a
  wooden dildo and marble statue of sexy bahamat and onxy statue of sexy dwarf
- Anais examines the body they dig up, no blunt for trauma but a bite mark and no blood
- The sun sets and bodies rise from the ground
- After a LONG battle we are able to defeat the vampires we find love letters and a key, and a small amount of gold
- Various people fall injured
- We decide to head to Inn attempt to take a short rest on the second floor
- Lucian shows up and demands his staff back (he is an envoy of the vampires -- not their leader)
- After a failed attempt to convince him we don't have the staff. Anais attempts to charm him and he resists and attacks us
- Aelar is chamred but luckily Druisillia has a Sunbeam spell and is able to mess up Lucian with it
- Lucian is killed in sunlight turning him to ash and a permanent death
- We enter the church dungeon to follow the footprints we had seen earlier, there was no path into town so they aren't
  Lucian's. The footprints are larger than typical for a human
- We follow the tunnel and emerge outside of town, the trail continues south on the road
- On our way southward we see a large silver dragon in the sky and hide in the trees from it
- We leave the road to head towards Devil's Breach and make camp at the base of the mountains nearby

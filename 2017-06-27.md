# Session 23 - Minotaurs & Human Sacrifices

We're 2/4 prophets dead (we have Marlos' weapon, but not Vannifer's) and we know about all 4 cults.

- We find Grommash an orc fighter, Dar leaves to help her people
- Head north and find a sarcophagus with a glyph of warding that Fear detects and diffuses
- The sarchophagus contains Grommash's gear and we graciously decide to give it to him
- Under cover of Druisillia's Pass Without Trace we being to explore the dungeon
- To the east there are a couple minotaurs and a weird carving on floor (perhaps a blood ritual?)
- To the northwest is the bottom of the fire hole we found earlier but we still can't summon the elevato
- We enter another room and find 3 sleeping minotaurs and the burnt out corpse of an orc
- Nearig the staircase in the northeast we find a set of cart rails and old mining carts and 4 spectres guarding it
- There is a bit of a battle but Fear casts turn undead and kills all the remaining spectres immediately 
- We head south and take a short rest in the corridor to the north of house of XXX and OOO
- As we attempt to sneak to the southern part of the dungeon both Aelar and Anais stumble and attract the attention of
  the minotaurs
- We kill 3 minotaurs but before killing them all they summon Zagdar!!
- 3 more minotaurs (1 of which is bossy) arrive along with a 1 eyed slug with claws (that we saw earlier hanging with
  the minotaur "cowering behind the flames")
- We manage to defeat them but are seriously depleted in health and spells (but not in spirit!)
- We learn the password for the elevator ash and ember, what we don't realize is the elevator can go down another level
- We take a safe long rest
- We return to the site of the carving on the floor and learn that this is made by drow and elves. The floor carving 
  is a part of a drow summoning ritual conjur room. They can use this to summon demons however these circles are damaged
  to the point of being useless.
- We continue to pass southwards through these smoky puke doors
- Eventually we come to a room with dozens of dead warriors from earth and fire cults filling it. A whirlwind of air greets us and we are able to
  trick them into thinking we are with the air cult. We recover 5 air cult disguises
- There's a magical torch with a dead water cultist dead next to it
- We head through to a room that is large open area there is a howling wind that compels Anais to climb the walls
- Luckily she sucks at climbing and falls and Grommash restrains her
- We find 5 balloon packs (can be used to levitate or feather fall) and a pit that is 80 feet deep
- Instead of heading down the pit we decide to keep exploring
- Aelar sneaks into a smoky room where there are prisoners manacle to the wall.
- We rescue one person from the manacles on the wall, they were a sailor that was captured is freed from the manacles.
- We use him to test the orb we found sitting ominously in a nearby room. It kills him with some magical swords.
- We decide to rescue another prisoner (Ingrid?) who is a captured fire cultist
- We play some tic tac toe and eventually sneak into the crystal hallway during a sneezing fit (the crystals help anais'
  allergies)
- Going into it we encounter earth cultists and some some earth elementals
- Ingrid is still hanging out watching the slaughter as the battle ends

# Session 21 - Temple of the Black Earth

- We rest, someone enters and yells Vannifer is dead
- We rest more
- We emerge and find the temple empty
- We find many footprints and stuff indicating people fled
- We find a secret room that is a dwarven grave
  - We fail repeatedly to try to open the sarcophagi
  - We roid up Dar via spells and finally get into it
  - There's a skeleton with a bunch of personal items in it (we mysteriously are unwilling to steal the mask of a dead dwarven lorg)
- We advance into a new area of the temple and encounter a dwarven statue with two spiked balls for hands
  - It awakens!!
  - We fight it and it is immune to nearly everything, many spells are cast and it dies
- We return to the rest of the temple
  - Anais tosses a body off the disk and listens to it splash
  - Fear discovers that the levitating disk could be commanded but we don't know how
  - Anais tries unsuccessfully to learn to control it (she refuses to acknowledge this though)
- We investigate the rest of the area
  - Stumble upon a Chimera guarding treasure
  - Chimera is tricked with Raz's illusion into wandering away, Aelar shoots an arrow that draws the attention of a orcs nearby that rush and get slaughtered
  - Druisillia tries to speak to the "sad looking" Chimera, it turns out it is sad because we stole its treasure and wants to kill us
  - We kill it (but Anais eldritch blasts Aelar)
- We then rest and are interrupted repeatedly by black earth members (easily killed)
- Then disguised as cultists with naked prisoner ventured foward stumbled upon a group of black earth cultists torturing some people
  - We killed them (though they were suprisingly difficult)
  - Aelar died twice
  - Orna (female human black earth guard) is one of the prisoners but is not part of the delegation, she was sheltered but then slapped a priest and then was jailed
  - Droth is a catatonic air cult member (most tortured)

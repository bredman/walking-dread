- the recent history of sunshard, the place where we are
  - Empress Carnelia, an elf was ruler until recently. Her rule was considered fair and just. Her father, Carnelius, ruled before her. The Sun Empire has been strong, but also lax. They respected the diversity of this world, and especially outside of the continent of Tarim itself let the people make some of their own laws, as long as they paid taxes to the empire. There have always been pirates, small bands of bandits, and the occasional monster to deal with... but war is not something this land has known for decades. The last major war was a rebellion that became a civil war when Carnelius was in power. The dynasty stayed in power, but did loosen its grip especially on the other continents, which the rebels saw as a small victory.
  - The vampire Legion of Dusk, later on, started a war and took control over the Eastern Continents.
  - The Aasimar came through a portal from Celestia, sent by their god Bahamut to spread His Word, they say.
  - The Aasimar first came through 5 years ago. Initially, they arrived as missionaries. They established temples to Bahamut in a few cities, and Carnelia allowed them to do so peacefully. This lasted about a year. They attempted to recruit people to their religion, peacefully, and did gain some followers (say, 2% of the population, mostly humans).
  - They sent special ambassadors to the capital city of Tarn try to convert Carnelia herself, and they wanted to make the government into a theocracy. Carnelia was a follower of Chauntea, Goddess of Agriculture herself, and was unwilling. This took about another year. Eventually they tried magical methods to get her to see the light, and he succeeded his saving throw and responded by casting them out and stating they were unwelcome. However, more and more of them had come through, and they had a larger army than Carnelia by then.
  - They sacked the capital and publicly executed the empress, claiming she was an unredeemable heretic. They declared themselves to be in power and appointed a leader named Diava, and sent religious texts and missionaries to all known settlements on Tarim. Eventually they sent soldiers too. A surprising number of local leaders were converted. It took about another year for them to gain a presence in most major cities. There are still small settlements without any Aasimar in them on Tarim, but no cities there. They have begun to establish a foothold in Eastern Valynar as well. Nothing east of the Surging Sea yet though.
  - It's been 2 years since then. Nobody knows how many Aasimar there are in this world now, but spies of the guilds seem to think that other than the capital most cities don't have more than 100 of them, and not all are warriors.
  - On two occasions, a city has risen up and slain the Aasimar in it, and taken power back. But always, they return in greater numbers, and the retribution from the Aasimar is swift and vicious. The first was Kirkwall, and the Aasimar slew many and subdued the rest. The second was Oar's Rest, who fought to the death. The entire city was razed and the island is now officially unpopulated, though various rumors exist that some group might be living there again.
  - Most people are too scared to rise up against them, but it's not easy to live life within their laws, especially if one is not rich. Nobody knows all the laws, and sometimes it seems as though the Aasimar invent laws when it is convenient to them to punish someone they don't like.
  - Biggest punishments for crimes of heresy: worshipping false idols, proseltyzing false religions
  - The Aasimar know that money comes with power. They are more lax with the richest citizens, who only have to pay lip service to the religion but don't have to truly believe or follow every little law
  - The Aasimar tend not to roam outside cities much, but there are other dangers. Besides bandits, there are many magical creatures in this world. In fact, it sometimes seems as if those creatures specifically target the thieves when they are traveling or hiding out. [they are indeed, the Aasimar are controlling them]
  - It is rumored that if you kill an Aasimar, they simply return to the Celestial Plane, and eventually make their way back to this realm if they so choose.```

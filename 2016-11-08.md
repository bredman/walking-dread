# Session 16 - The election happened

* lots of debating about the key shards, the doors they open, and what it all means
* talked to the wind tower dude a bit, ate breakfast
* haven't admitted they're a cult; maybe the cult is only a subset of them?
* challenged us to go kill another manticore to further earn the favor of the Feathergale Knights
* set out to do that, south east
* saw a giant vulture circling to the north east, went to check it out
* also fire hawks circling
* there was a corpse on the ground, the vulture attacked us
* haley tried to talk to it, but it wouldn't listen
* we beat the shit out of it, until it started talking
* just wanted to guard its lunch - some old humanoid
* headed south towards the manticore cave
* argued about what a plateau is
* found a big pack of gnolls and hyenas
* failed lots and lots of attacks, haley almost dies
* finally killed them all

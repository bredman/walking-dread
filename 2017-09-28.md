- As we head north to loot the dungeon we are attacked by cultists on the water and then we are also attacked by two (tough) crabs with tentacles instead of ten from the water
- We head north again and then a crazy ceiling creature fucks us up and we run
- We rest together in the to recover after some serious damage
- We head north and find a number of wrecked ships, as we head to investigate a Hydra attacks us from the depths of the water!
- We kill it and get lots of cool shit
- On our way out we head to a secret room in the temple and fine a coral throne with a jewel encrusted narwhal horn resting against it
- When Anais touches it she is transported to entrance to the temple, others touch it and see nothing
- She takes us to the entrance but we can't find anything to do with the horn
- We decide to explore the western side of the temple but find traps and giant crabs
- Anais tries to reason with the crabs and fails, she then tries to give the crab hallucinogenic mushrooms (which fails), then she tries to give the crab our (5000 gp) diamond

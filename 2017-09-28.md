# Session 26 - We find a jeweled narwhal horn (and save the world)

- As we head north to loot the dungeon we are attacked by cultists on the water and then we are also attacked by two (tough) crabs with tentacles instead of ten from the water
- We head north again and then a crazy ceiling creature fucks us up and we run
- We rest together in the portal room to recover after some serious damage
- We head north and find a number of wrecked ships, as we head to investigate a Hydra attacks us from the depths of the water!
- We chop off some heads, but kill if before it grows them back. We get lots of cool shit
- On our way out we head to a secret room in the temple and fine a coral throne with a jewel encrusted narwhal horn resting against it
- When Anais touches it she has a vision of the entrance to the temple, others touch it and see nothing
- She takes us to the entrance but we can't find anything to do with the horn
- We decide to explore the western side of the temple but find traps and giant crabs
- Anais tries to reason with the crabs and fails, she then tries to give the crab hallucinogenic mushrooms (which fails), then she tries to give the crab our (5000 gp) diamond
- Fear lunges and saves the diamond, we escape the temple
- We head over to the howling air temple
- Aelar sees some bodies with some nice jewels and decides to investigate, he nearly dies but also gets some sweet stuff
- After stumbling through a disturbing number of bodies we are attacked by an air elemental which we slayed
- Eventually we find the ruins of an underground city. We discover that this is the Svirfvalin settlement that's in ruins, the human bodies in the city were killed.
- As we try to exit we are attacked by a large air goblin. We kill it
- We find a couple humans and a drow and a bird person on a hook. We heal a few of them and find they were captured by the air cult. We heal them but then when one flees Anais decides to kill them, causing the other two to flee.
- In the middle of a shallow lake, we use the balloon packls to climb a pedestal
- At the top is a coffin containing the body of Godwid the Wormbane Dragonslayer and Peacekeeper - we steal his sword
- We have to fight a weird blob thing and kill it
- Anais is able to charm a giant gorilla and we are able to get it to escort us to the altar
- Yan-C-Bin has been summoned through the portal by Aerisi Kalinoth!
- Yan-C-Bin has some crazy tough spells - the floor is ice, everyone gets smashed around
- Aerisi turns invisible, Fear dispells it, then gets knocked unconcious
- It's touch-and-go, but Aerisi dies, Grommash is able to grab Aerisi's weapon using a levitation spell to get there and throw it through the portal
- The portal is closed and Yan-C-Bin is sucked back inside
- We find crazy treasure
- Insiladun appears and voices his appreciation for our saving of the elemental plane
- He gives us a scroll of sending to contact him when we're ready for a new mission
- We head back to the Bargewright Inn to buy some magical weapons

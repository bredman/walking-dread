# Session 34 - Up the river and into the woods

- We release our horses, keeping their saddles and shit
- We paddle up river and encounter a group of creatures feasting on something on the riverbank
- We end up fighting them (after greasing the boat with mayo)
- After defeating a couple of them two hags emerge from the woods
- They throw chains at the boat and pull us to shore (somehow avoiding the mayo coating)
- Anais kills the last hag but also has a critical miss, she has falls into critical hug and drops her charm. After a
  panic she casts guidance and recovers it
- We paddle along the river to Weyss Lock through the night and head along the shore to the north of The Dark Forest
- We walk midway between the cliffs and the shore, it eventually leads us to a gnoll encampment
- After inspecting from afar we decide to send Raz into sneak up and kill the one guard we see
- Raz crit fails and stumbles on a rock mid-attack alerting everyone and falling to the ground
- We cast various area spells while he is trapped on the ground unconscious (a higher level gnoll emerges too)
- Druisillia sees "something" in the forest but doesn't tell us what she sees
- Druisillia feels increasing dread until she is paralyzed by it, Grommash carries her onwards
- Eventually Fear, Aelar, and Anais are overcome by a desire to go into the forest
- After Fear tries to walk into the forest Aelar follows him
- Grommash grapples Fear and stuffs him into the hole
- Aelar is heading towards the woods
- Anais has made ~it to the woods~ near to the edge of the woods

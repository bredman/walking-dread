# Session 14 - The one with the bats

(Andy Timmons stepped in to play Fear)

Our battle with the burning man was over and we were a bit worse for wear from it but sprits were high. We looked
around and saw the tower we had yet to explore nearby beckoning us. Aelar advocated a brief rest before venturing into
it to explore (partially due to hangover and partially due to injuries) but he was overruled and we ventured into into
the tower.

After climbing up the stairs on the side of the tower we hadn't inavertantly burned down we entered the tower to find
ourselves on an elevated platform inside the tower facing an angry looking dward with a flaming beard and hammer. The dwarf did not stand alone and had two flame acolytes at his side. Fear immediately cast a spell which created a gust of wind which knocked one acolyte off the platform and knocked over the dwarf. After this we made quick work of them as they were dazed from the injuries sustained in the wind.

After the battle we find ourselves alone on the platform and can see a ladder on the opposite side of the tower but
across a large gap. Fear gracefully offers to blow our party across the gap. Azagul and Aelar both immediately
volunteer and shortly afterwards find themselves on the other side but Aelar is a bit disappointed and starts yelling
about a misunderstanding. Drusillia refuses to be blown and decides to leap across the gap but doesn't quite make it
and tumbles down with the grace of a wolf. She (and others?) make quick work of the flame imps below and we then throw
them a rope to allow them all to climb up to the platform with the ladder.

Regrouped we climb up the ladder together to the next level. We find some humans resting and attempt to sneak up on
them but fail critically and waken the resting party. We quickly kill a fire priest that had awakened (and observe an
ominously squeaking floor) and then out of nowhere a man smoking a fire pipe floats down from the floor above.
Suitably awed we immediately fall into default mode and begin murdering. After many fireballs and many steps across
creaky floors Azaghul finally collapses the creaky floor and the fire pipe dude falls after falling 30 feet.

Dar and Aelar climb up to the attic and find 4 giant bats. Dar has something about bats and gets a bit paniced and
starts flinging her sword like a 14 year boy doing a lightsaber demonstration in his garage. Aelar put on a good show of
the more classic sword swinging he is sometimes known for and quickly dispatched the bats. Dar did not take this well.

Fear clamored up the ladder and he and Dar climbed up to the roof and were able to see a spire to the west through the
haze. We decide to head that way assuming it to be Feathergale Spire.

As we depart we loot the encampments and find numerous scrolls, one of which is sky writing scroll which Dar
immediately uses to write "Fuck you Aelar" across the sky. Aelar says anytime.
